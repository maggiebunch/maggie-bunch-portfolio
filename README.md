This website was created as part of Out-of-Class Assignment No. 4 to demonstrate my ability to design, build, and publish a multi-page, fully responsive site using HTML and CSS. The purpose of this site is to showcase my work in journalism, strategic communications, and audience strategy in a clean and intentional way that reflects my professional brand.

The site includes multiple pages—Home, About, Work, and Contact—with working navigation, responsive layouts, and project pages that highlight samples of my content and strategy work. All images, text, and media included on this site are original and legally usable. The project is published using GitHub Pages and includes this README to document the website’s purpose and assignment requirements.
